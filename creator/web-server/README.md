# This project was used to create the energy ball JSON file animations

`main.mjs`:

A simple web server that serves the index.html and optionally a directory that contains all the files that were generated by the `all-in-one` program.

`index.html`:
The front-end used to take all the files and create a memory footprint out of them to be used to increase the FPS of animations to almost infinite using the memory instead of IO/Network usage (cache).

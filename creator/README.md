# This project was used to create the energy ball JSON file animations

`all-in-one.py`:

Takes all the files in the current directory and converts them to a sequence of compressed and transparent webp animations.

Also validates that the images are not corrupted.

Easy to use, Close and open to start from where you've been (Smart!)

Automatically detects the difference between an MP4, PNG, JPG/JPEG, and WEBP files to produce the desired outcome.

`all-in-one-multi.py`:

Same as all-in-one but also multi-threaded for up to 8 threads at the same time!
